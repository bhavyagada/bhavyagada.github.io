  <h2>Hello World</h2>
  <p>
    I've always wanted to write online and become prolific at it. I struggled before because my work didn't meet 
    my standards. Being a beginner sucks. Ira Glass captures the feeling well:
  </p>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/309485-nobody-tells-this-to-people-who-are-beginners-i-wish">
    <p><em>
      Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get 
      into it because we have good taste. <strong>But there is this gap.</strong> For the first couple years you make 
      stuff, <strong>it's just not that good.</strong> It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your 
      taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. 
      <strong>A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit.</strong> Most people I know who do interesting, 
      creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. 
      We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal 
      and <strong>the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work.</strong> Put yourself on a deadline so that 
      every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, 
      and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I've 
      ever met. <strong>It's gonna take awhile.</strong> It's normal to take awhile. <strong>You've just gotta fight 
      your way through.</strong>
    </q></em>

    My views have changed since my last attempt. I realized that:
    <ul>
      <li>Closing the gap between what I make and my standards requires a sea of imperfect work.</li>
      <li>Consistency and quantity of work are more important than quality.</li>
      <li>My thoughts are not a good proxy for determining the value of my work.</li>
      <li>What's obvious to me is not obvious to others, and vice versa.</li>
      <li>My work might not add anything to the world, but it adds something to me. It makes me findable.</li>
      <li>Originality is overrated. Everything is a remix. Aim to be prolific instead.</li>
      <li>Play long-term games. Time will pass anyway.</li>
      <li>I can just do things.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    So, that's my plan. I'll write about whatever interests me <span>&#8212;</span> my thoughts on various topics, 
    learnings, projects, life updates, etc. I think that's how I will stay committed to doing this.

    Thanks for being here.
